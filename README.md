# Employee Gatepass System using Arduino

## Overview

The Employee Gatepass System using Arduino is a project aimed at automating the issuance and management of gate passes for employees within an organization. This system leverages Arduino microcontrollers, RFID technology, and a web-based interface to provide a seamless and efficient solution for monitoring employee access to secure areas.

## Features

- Automated gate pass issuance based on RFID authentication.
- Real-time tracking of employee movements.
- Web-based dashboard for administration and monitoring.
- Alerts and notifications for gate pass approvals and denials.
- Logging and reporting of employee access history.

## Components

- Arduino Uno/Nano (or similar) microcontroller.
- RFID reader and RFID tags/cards.
- Ethernet/Wi-Fi module for internet connectivity.
- LCD display for local status indication.
- Push buttons for manual controls.
- Web server (can be hosted locally or on a cloud platform).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iamrajarajanr/employee-gatepass.git`
2. Upload Arduino sketch to the microcontroller.
3. Set up the web server (instructions in `web/README.md`).

## Usage

1. Ensure the Arduino and RFID hardware are connected and powered.
2. Access the web dashboard to manage gate pass requests and view logs.
3. Employees swipe their RFID tags to request and validate gate passes.
4. Admins approve or deny gate pass requests via the web interface.
